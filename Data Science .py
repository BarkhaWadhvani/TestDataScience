# # Introduction to Arithmetic Expressions
# 
# 
# Arithmetic expressions involve mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. In Python, you can perform these operations using operators like +, -, *, and /.
# 
# 

# # Add an Multiply numbers

# In[6]:


a=5
b=10
print("Addition of Two numbers",a+b)
print("Multiplication of two numbers",a*b)


# # Convert Minutes to  Hour

# In[7]:


# Input: Number of minutes
minutes = 120  # Replace this with the number of minutes you want to convert

# Convert minutes to hours
hours = minutes / 60

# Output the result
print(f"{minutes} minutes is equal to {hours} hours.")
